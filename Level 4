🛰️ Bandit Level 03 ➜ 04

🎯 Challenge Overview

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file inside the inhere directory.
Hidden files in Linux start with a dot (.) and are not shown using a normal ls command.

Once the hidden file is identified, its contents can be read to obtain the password.
